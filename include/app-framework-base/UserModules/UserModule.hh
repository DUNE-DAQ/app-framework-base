 * The UserModule interface defines the required functionality for all UserModules that use the Application Framework.
 * UserModules are defined as "a set of code which performs a specific task". They are connected to one another within
 * a DAQ Application by Buffer instances, in a graph defined by a ModuleList.
 *
 * This interface is intended to define only absolutely necessary methods to be able to support the many different tasks that
 * UserModules will be asked to perform.
 *
 * This is part of the DUNE DAQ Application Framework, copyright 2020.
 * Licensing/copyright details are in the COPYING file that you should have received with this code.
